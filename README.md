#The difference between interface and types are given below:

the interface can extend other interface or types but in type need to intersection. In this way both can mutate to a different kind of each type.

If you can about merging then interface supports it but not the types. And the main difference is the interface is mostly used for object to gain readability but type uses on others.


# TypeScript helps in improving code quality and project maintainability.

If we talk about the type safety it is the main characteristics. This prevent bugs at compile time. It has better autocomplete and intellisence. It is self documented. So, like interface and types helps coder understand what it says. 

As it strict to follow one nich for which easy to scale up. Cause every developer can understand how the things work round.

For all this big company like google, microsoft etc. use typescript to reduce bugs in production, speed up development.
